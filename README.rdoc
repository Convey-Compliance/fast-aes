= FastAES - Fast AES implementation for Ruby in C

This is a lightweight, fast implementation of AES (the US government's Advanced Encryption Standard)
written in C for speed.  You can read more on the {Wikipedia AES Page}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard].

This library supports a subset of AES functionality, specifically 129, 192, and 256-bit ciphers only.

== Installation

  gem install gemcutter
  gem install fast-aes
  
== Example

  require 'fast_aes'  # note underscore

  aes = FastAES.new(key)   # can be 128, 192, or 256 bits
  
  text = "Hey there"

  data = aes.encrypt(text, text.length)
  puts aes.decrypt(data, data.length)   # "Hey there"

== Special Note

As this software deals with encryption/decryption, please note there is NO WARRANTY, even
with regards to FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  *This means if you use this library,
and it turns out there's a flaw in the implementation that results in your data being
hacked, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.*  It's YOUR responsibility to check the implementation of this
library.
